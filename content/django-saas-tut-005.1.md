# Tutorial 005.1 – Code Review Improvements

After tutorial-005, we decided that it was time to conduct a code review. We recommend doing thorough code reviews periodically and addressing any issues identifid.

This short addendum captures the production-hardening changes applied after the code review. It’s meant as a companion to the earlier tutorials.

See the [code review](code_review_001.md).

## What we hardened

1) Security headers for production
- Added HTTPS-only protections when `DEBUG=False`: HSTS (1 year, preload, include subdomains), secure cookies, SSL redirect, basic CSP for CDN assets, and browser XSS filter.
- Enforced `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` must be set in production.

2) Safer proxy handling
- Introduced `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` env flag and only honor `X-Forwarded-For` when it is true.
- Validate client IPs with `validate_ipv46_address`; discard malformed values.

3) Health check opacity
- Health endpoint now returns minimal JSON (`{"status": "ok"}` or `{"status": "error"}`) while still probing DB connectivity. No internal details are exposed.

4) Click analytics performance
- Link detail view now aggregates clicks entirely in the database and limits results (top referrers/agents, recent clicks selecting only needed fields). Prevents memory blowups for high-traffic links.

5) Slug robustness
- Slugs validated to lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores; generation length increased to 10 with bounded retries and clear error on exhaustion.
- Form input slugs normalized to lowercase; uniqueness stays per-user.

6) Logging hygiene
- Scrubbed sensitive data (emails/usernames) from auth logs; retain only `user_id` for auditing. Failed login logs no longer echo user input.

7) Admin status
- Custom admin for `CustomUser` already present (list display, filters, search, fieldsets). Optional: add `date_joined` to `list_display`/`readonly_fields` if you want that column.

## What’s deferred

- Rate limiting for login and password reset will be covered in a future tutorial.

## Quick verification commands

```bash
# Core tests including the updated health check expectations
python manage.py test core.tests.HealthCheckTests

# Link app tests for slug and analytics behavior
python manage.py test links
```

## Environment flags to remember

- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (required when `DEBUG=False`)
- `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` (set to true only when behind a trusted proxy/load balancer)

## Takeaway

These changes lock down surface area, improve resilience under load, and reduce data leakage. They’re safe defaults for moving toward production while keeping the tutorial code lean.
